Estimation techniques

Overview: In this exercise, you will construct several estimators and comparethe results. You will implement Bayesian and linear MMSE estimators.

Scenario 1:Implement the Bayes MMSE and Linear MMSE estimators from examples 8.5 and 8.6.Simulate this system by random draws of Y and W, and then estimating Y from theobservations X = Y + W. Verify that your simulation is correct by comparingtheoretical and empirical values of the MSE. Report your results in a table.

Scenario 2:Implement the linear estimator for multiple noisy observations,similar to example 8.8 from the notes. Extend this example so that it works foran arbitrary number of observations. Use Gaussian random variables for Y and R.Set Î¼y = 1. Experiment with a few different variances for both Y and R. On oneplot, show the mean squared error of your simulation compared to the theoreticalvalues for at least 2 different pairs of variances.
